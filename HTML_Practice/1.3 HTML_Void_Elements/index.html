<h2>1. Poem: "The Road Not Taken"</h2>

   <h3>Author: Robert Frost</h3>

   <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
   And sorry I could not travel both<br />
   And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
   And looked down one as far as I could<br />
   To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br />

   <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
   And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
   Though as for that the passing there<br />
   Had worn them really about the same,</p>

   <p>And both that morning equally lay<br />
   In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
   Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
   Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
   I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

   <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
   Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
   Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br />
   I took the one less traveled by,<br />
   And that has made all the difference.</p>

<h2>2. Poem: "The Raven"</h2>

   <h3>Author: Edgar Allan Poe</h3>

   <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br />
   Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br />
   While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br />
   As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br />
   “Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br />
               Only this and nothing more.”<br />

   <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br />
   And each separate dying ember writhed upon the floor.<br />
   From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br />
   For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br />
               Nameless here for evermore.</p>

   <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br />
   Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br />
   So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br />
   “Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br />
   Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br />
               This it is and nothing more.”</p>
