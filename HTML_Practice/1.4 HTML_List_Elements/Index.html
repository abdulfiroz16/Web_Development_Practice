<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<h3>Marinating the Chicken:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Let it marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cooking the Rice:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Wash the Basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add salt, bay leaf, green cardamom pods, and cloves.</li>
    <li>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water.</li>
    <li>Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (still slightly firm). Drain and set aside.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Preparing the Biryani Masala:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large heavy-bottomed pan, heat oil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add thinly sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown and crisp. Remove half of the fried onions for garnish.</li>
    <li>Add green chilies, chopped tomatoes, red chili powder, and garam masala powder to the pan. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil separates.</li>
    <li>Add marinated chicken and cook until it changes color and is partially cooked.</li>
    <li>Add chopped mint and coriander leaves. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken mixture. Drizzle some ghee over the rice.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Dum Cooking (Slow Cooking):</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place a heavy lid or seal the edges of the pan with wheat dough to create a tight seal.</li>
    <li>Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes. This process is known as "dum cooking" and allows the flavors to meld together.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Final Assembly:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Remove the pan from heat and let it sit for a few minutes before opening.</li>
    <li>Gently fluff the Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani with a fork.</li>
    <li>Garnish with the reserved fried onions and saffron-soaked milk.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) or a side salad.</li>
</ol>
